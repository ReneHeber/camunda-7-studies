# camunda-7-studies
This repo is a multi module maven project. So there are several applications/projects 
or "modules" in it, which can be started separately (in your IDE). 
For example, a Camunda application and an external worker can be started in it at the same time.

The projects were mostly created to complete the tasks of the Camunda Academy training courses: 
https://partner-academy.camunda.com/page/camunda-7

There are the following trainings:
- Get started
- Camunda 7 - Platform for Java Developers
- Camunda 7 - Platform & Microservices
- Camunda 7 - Platform for DevOps
